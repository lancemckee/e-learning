Introduction to OGC
===================


  Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international industry consortium of about 500 companies,government agencies and universities participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available `standards <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/>`_. Standards support interoperable solutions that "geo-enable" the Web, wireless and location-based services and mainstream IT. The standards empower technology developers to make complex spatial information and services accessible and useful with all kinds of applications.Requirements range from complex scheduling and control of Earth observation satellites to displaying simple map images on the Web and encoding location with just few bytes for geo-tagging and messaging. A look at the OGC `Domain Working Groups <http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/wg>`_ shows the wide scope of current activity in the OGC.

OGC publishes standards and supported documents, define as follows:

* Implementation Specifications - Standard: Basis for working software; detail the interface structure between software components
* Abstract Specifications: Conceptual foundation / reference model for spec development
* Best Practices: Describe use of specifications
* Engineering Reports: Results from OGC Interoperability Program
* Discussion Papers: Mechanism for public review of concepts
* Change Requests: Capture formally comments by anyone.
